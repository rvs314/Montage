<p>This directory contains code from other works, which may have their own license and authorship different from what Montage has. Please refer to their folder for those information.</p>
<p>To integrate their core functionality to our harness for comparison, we extract minimum files/subfolders from their original distribution and make some necessary modification. Their origin and modification (if any) are listed as follows:</p>
<h2 id="libitm">1. <a href="https://pkgs.org/download/libitm">libitm</a></h2>
<p>No modification has been made. A dynamic library (.so) tested on Fedora 30 is included in the directory in case needed.</p>
<h2 id="mnemosyne-gcc">2. <a href="https://github.com/snalli/mnemosyne-gcc/tree/master">mnemosyne-gcc</a></h2>
<p>Mnemosyne is a persistent transactional memory system developed by H. Volos, A. J. Tack, and M. M. Swift. Its corresponding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1961296.1950379">paper</a> was published on ASPLOS’ 2011.</p>
<p>We clone the code from its <em>master</em> branch and made changes including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Comment out locks used for synchronizing statistic information collection in critical path.</li>
<li>Change persistent heap file path to <code>/mnt/pmem/psegments</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>clwb</code> instead of <code>clflush</code>, <code>mfence</code> instead of <code>sfence</code>, and DAX <code>mmap</code> (i.e., passing <code>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE | MAP_SYNC</code> as flag).</li>
<li>Refactor code to make the size of heap file more extendable and extend it to 32 GiB.</li>
<li>Add <code>Makefile</code> to <code>./ext/mnemosyne-gcc/usermode</code>.</li>
<li>Remove benchmarks of vacation and memcached as they are not used in our harness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please refer to <code>mne.diff</code> in <code>./ext/mnemosyne-gcc</code> for all nontrivial difference between our version and the vanilla Mnemosyne. The diff file assumes that original mnemosyne is located in the same level of the entire repository and is gotten by command <code>diff -r ../mnemosyne-gcc ./ext/mnemosyne-gcc &gt;&gt; ./ext/mnemosyne-gcc/mne.diff</code>.</p>
<h2 id="mod-single-repo">3. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3563186#.X3YlXmhKj-g">mod-single-repo</a></h2>
<p>MOD is a system that persists immutable data structures by S. Haria, M. D. Hill, and M. M. Swift. Its corresponding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378472">paper</a> was published on ASPLOS’ 2020.</p>
<p>We use only <code>immer/queue.hpp</code> and write our own concurrent hash table in <code>immer/unordered_map.hpp</code> based on <code>immer/detail/list/list.hpp</code>. These two headers utilize <code>nvm_malloc</code>. As a result, we keep only <code>Immutable-Datastructure-c++</code> and <code>nvm_malloc</code> and other directories are omitted.</p>
<p>Additional, we replace <code>clflushopt</code> by <code>clwb</code>. Please refer to <code>mod.diff</code> in <code>./ext/mod-single-repo</code> for all nontrivial difference between our version and the vanilla MOD.</p>
<h2 id="pronto-v1.1">4. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3605351#.X3YlJmhKj-g">pronto-v1.1</a></h2>
<p>Pronto is a system that persists arbitrary data structures by logging high-level operations with semantical information. Authored by A. Memaripour, J. Izraelevitz, and S. Swanson, its corresponding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378456">paper</a> was published on ASPLOS’ 2020.</p>
<p>In the harness, we implement our own hash table and queue with Pronto for experiments; they are named <code>ProntoQueue</code> and <code>ProntoHashTable</code>, located at <code>./src/rideables</code>.</p>
<p>We made several changes to the Pronto system including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Disable buggy free list coalescing in their allocator.</li>
<li>Fix typos in Makefile (mainly %s/-o3/-O3).</li>
<li>Change max thread number to 80 and adapt affinity rule to our machine (see below).</li>
<li>Change persistent heap file path to <code>/mnt/pmem</code>.</li>
<li>Use DAX <code>mmap</code> (i.e., passing <code>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE | MAP_SYNC</code> as flag) for snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please refer to <code>pronto.diff</code> in <code>./ext/pronto-v1.1</code> for all nontrivial difference between our version and the vanilla Pronto.</p>
<p>Note: We assume two-socket machine to be used for experiments. Each socket has 20 cores and 40 hyperthreads. The core is indexed such as {0,2,4…38} are 20 hyperthreads on individual cores of the first socket, {40,42,44…,78} are 20 sister threads of the previous 20 hyperthreads. Cores indexed by odd numbers are those on the second socket. Refer to <code>./ext/pronto-v1.1/src/thread.cpp:75</code> for the pinning map.</p>
<h2 id="ralloc">5. <a href="https://github.com/urcs-sync/ralloc">ralloc</a></h2>
<p>Ralloc is a lock-free persistent allocator that has competitive performance to even transient allocators. It is developed by W. Cai, H. Wen, H. A. Beadle, and M. L. Scott. Its corresponding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3332466.3374502">paper</a> was published on ISMM’ 2020.</p>
<p>We adjust its recovery routine so it instead returns a set of iterators and the heap is recovered on the way applications iterating through it. Please refer to <code>ralloc.diff</code> in <code>./ext/ralloc</code> for all nontrivial difference between our version and the vanilla Ralloc.</p>
<h2 id="threadcached-and-ycsb-tcd">6. <a href="https://github.com/ChrisKjellqvist/MemcachedProtectedLibrary/tree/nohodor">threadcached</a> and ycsb-tcd</h2>
<p>Threadcached is a variant of Memcached which links directly to a multithreaded client application, dispensing with the usual socket-based communication. Since we only focus on performance of persistence, its <code>nohodor</code> branch is used. Authored by C. Kjellqvist, M. Hedayati, and M. L. Scott, its corresponding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3404397.3404443">paper</a> was published on ICPP’ 2020.</p>
<p>The main changes are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replace allocator calls with generic ones so we can easily control which allocator to use.</li>
<li>Persist with Montage</li>
</ol>
<p>ycsb-tcd is a variant of C version YCSB, customized by C. Kjellqvist. Instead of communicating through socket, it directly calls into the threadcached library. This code wasn’t published by Kjellqvist himself yet, so please contact him for approval if you need to redistribute.</p>
<p>Please refer to <code>threadcached.diff</code> in <code>./ext/threadcached</code> for all nontrivial difference between our version and the vanilla Threadcached.</p>
<h2 id="pdmk">7. <a href="https://pmem.io/pmdk/">pdmk</a></h2>
<p>We include a copy of the <a href="https://pmem.io/pmdk/">Persistent Memory Development Kit</a> (version 1.10) created by the PMDK team at Intel.</p>
<h2 id="clevel-hashing">8. <a href="https://github.com/chenzhangyu/Clevel-Hashing">CLevel-Hashing</a></h2>
<p>We use the copy of the library which is distributed with the <a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/chenzhangyu/Clevel-Hashing">Clevel Hashing</a> project, which implements the data structure described by the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-chen.pdf">2020 paper "Lock-Free Concurrent Level Hashing for Persistent Memory</a> by Zhangyu Chen, Yu Hua, Bo Ding, and Pengfei Zuo from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>This uses a modified version of the <a href="https://pmem.io/libpmemobj-cpp/">libpmemobj++</a> library, which provides C++ bindings to <a href="https://pmem.io/pmdk/libpmemobj">libpmemobj</a>. The bindings were originally created by the <a href="#7-pdmk">PDMK team</a></p>
